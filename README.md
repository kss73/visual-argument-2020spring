# Project 2: Visual Argument / Rhetorical Collage

For my rhetorical visual argument, I decided to create a flyer that motivates others to learn a new language. I have always felt that people that grew up bilingual seemed to be a little more open to otherâ€™s cultures and brought people closer. I feel that if everyone attempts to try to learn a new language it would open so many doors for them with traveling, careers and overall make one more open minded. I found a clipart of 5 diverse individuals and colored their faces. I added a background with worldwide landmarks and a airplane to emphasize traveling. Finally I also added clouds saying "Hello" in different languages.
